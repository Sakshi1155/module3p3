# Social Media Contract

A basic Ethereum smart contract for a social media application where users can write posts and create profiles on the blockchain.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (for package management)
- **Remix IDE** (for contract development to obtain the ABI and contract address)
- **MetaMask** (or another Ethereum wallet)

## Installing

### Compiling and Deploying the Contract
1. Compile the Solidity contract (`SocialMedia.sol`) using Remix IDE or any other development environment.
2. Deploy the compiled contract using MetaMask (injected Web3) to obtain the contract address and ABI.
3. Deploy the contract to your preferred Ethereum network (local, testnet, or mainnet).

### Frontend Setup
1. Create an `index.html` file for the frontend layout.
2. Create a `style.css` file for basic styling.
3. Create a `script.js` file for interaction with the deployed smart contract using your contract ABI and address.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet to the correct Ethereum network.
3. Use the form to create a profile by entering your name and bio.
4. View existing posts displayed on the page.

## Example Code

Here is an example of how to interact with the smart contract in `script.js`:

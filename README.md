Social Media Contract
A basic Ethereum smart contract for a social media application. Users can write posts and create profiles on the blockchain.

Prerequisites
Node.js (for package management)

Installing
Compiling and Deploying the Contract
Compile the Solidity contract (SocialMedia.sol) using Remix IDE or your preferred development environment.
Use injected MetaMask to deploy the contract and obtain the contract address and ABI.
Deploy the compiled contract to your chosen Ethereum network (local, testnet, or mainnet).
Frontend
Create the following files for the frontend:

index.html: Main HTML structure for the application.
style.css: Add custom styles for the layout.
script.js: JavaScript file to interact with the Ethereum smart contract, where you will include the deployed ABI, contract address, and references to the provider, signer, and contract.
Usage
Open index.html in your web browser.
Connect your MetaMask wallet to the appropriate Ethereum network.
Use the form to create a profile by entering your name and bio.
